# Calculator
This project is about a calculator that I made using three languages: 
1. HTML (Hyper Text mark-up Language)
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
3. Javascript
   
   
It has different tools that we usually know on a calculator such as:
1. Factorial
2. Brackets
3. Square root
4. Numbers
5. Operations,....
